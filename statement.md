## *1. Problem Statement*

Managing student academic records manually can be time-consuming, unorganized, and prone to errors. Teachers or administrators often need a simple system to store student details, enter marks for different tasks, and quickly calculate overall performance. Without a structured tool, tasks such as updating records, calculating averages, or viewing individual student details become difficult.
The Student Grade Management System (SGMS) aims to solve this problem by providing a basic, terminal-based program to record, manage, and analyze student grades efficiently.

## *2. Scope of the Project*

The project focuses on creating a basic grade management system that runs through the terminal. It includes features such as student data entry, task creation, mark entry, user authentication, and essential statistical calculations.
The scope is limited to academic record management only and does not include advanced features like weighted grades, graphical dashboards, or database integration. The project is designed to be simple and easy to understand for first-year students.
